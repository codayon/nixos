## My NixOS Configuration
Introduction & Description: In this repo, I will be continuously updating my current nixos configuration. There are several reasons why I use NixOS instead of other distrobutions but the reasons I want to highlight is that I wanted to learn something different, difficult and unique. But at first, it felt really easy and fun to me. Probably because of the declarative approach of doing things. And surely, I would not recommend this distribution to everyone over something like debian or maybe I will depending on the person and their motives. And most importantly, I am also going to use this repo to flex and say that I use NixOS btw.
